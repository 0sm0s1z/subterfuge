<h1> Welcome to the Subterfuge Project</h1>
<h2>Discover Artemis!</h2>
<h4>
The Subterfuge Team has been working on a new secret project! Artemis is an advanced malware simulation suite capable of emulating the Advanced Persistent Threat. Artemis raises the bar allowing ethical hackers and penetration testers the luxury of an advanced set of features equivalent to many of the tools employed by criminal gangs today. By abstracting polymorphism to a server based platform at <a href='http://cevincere.com'>cevincere.com</a> Artemis is able to stay one step ahead of anti-virus vendors, and ensure that penetration testers can give their clients the value that they deserve.<br>

<h3>Subterfuge Teaser</h3>

Summary:

Walk into Starbucks, plop down a laptop, click start, watch the credentials roll in. Enter Subterfuge, a Framework to take the arcane art of Man-in-the-Middle Attack and make it as simple as point and shoot. A beautiful, easy to use interface which produces a more transparent and effective attack is what sets Subterfuge apart from other attack tools. Subterfuge demonstrates vulnerabilities in the ARP Protocol by harvesting credentials that go across the network, and even exploiting machines through race conditions. Now walk into a corporation…

A rapidly-expanding portion of today’s Internet strives to increase personal efficiency by turning tedious or complex processes into a framework which provides instantaneous results. On the contrary, much of the information security community still finds itself performing manual, complicated tasks to administer and protect their computer networks. Given the increase in automated hacking tools, it is surprising that a simplistic, “push-button” tool has not been created for information security professionals to validate their networks’ ability to protect against a Man-In-The-Middle attack. Subterfuge is a small but devastatingly effective credential-harvesting program which exploits a vulnerability in the Address Resolution Protocol. It does this in a way that a non-technical user would have the ability, at the push of a button, to harvest all of the usernames and passwords of victims on their connected network, thus equipping information and network security professionals with a “push-button” security validation tool.

<h4>This video is a short teaser for Subterfuge, and was released at DEFCON 20 in 2012. Thank you to all of the early Beta testers who helped us make this possible. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbiXMlhykSQ'>Enjoy the Video!</a></h4>
